## NOTES

You may want to change vsync or refresh rate option in picom. I have shadows disabled in this particular rice because it felt more cohesive --kind of pen and paper-esque. Just felt right. Feel free to tinker to your likings however.

I use i3lock & betterlockscreen in place of a logindm. The power menu will call to a betterlockscreen script.
